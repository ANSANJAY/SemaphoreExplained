# 📝 Interview Revision Notes: Types of Semaphores 🚦

## Introduction 🌐
Semaphores are crucial for ensuring thread and process synchronization. They can be divided into two primary types: unnamed semaphores and named semaphores.

## 1. Unnamed Semaphores 🚫🏷️
- **Definition**: These semaphores don't have a specific name associated with them.
- **Usage**:
  - For synchronizing threads.
  - For synchronizing related processes. 
- **Related Processes**: Processes which originate from the same parent, typically created using the `fork` system call.
    - For instance, if a process `P1` invokes `fork`, it can generate a child process, `P2`. Here, `P1` and `P2` are related processes.
  
## 2. Named Semaphores 🏷️
- **Definition**: These semaphores have a distinct name that makes them uniquely identifiable in the system.
- **Creation**: Unlike unnamed semaphores which are treated as general data structures, named semaphores are provided with a specific name during their creation.
- **Usage**:
  - For synchronizing threads of the same process.
  - For synchronizing related or unrelated processes.
  - Especially used for synchronization between two unrelated processes on the same machine.
  
## Synchronization Scope Diagram 🌌
1. **Mutex and Condition Variable**: Limited to synchronizing threads of the same process.
2. **Unnamed Semaphores**: Extended to synchronization between threads and related processes.
3. **Named Semaphores**: Broadest scope, can synchronize between any two entities; whether they are threads, related processes, or unrelated processes.

# 🤔 Interview Questions & Answers ❓🔖

**Q1**: What are the main categories of semaphores?
> **A**: Semaphores are primarily categorized into *unnamed semaphores* and *named semaphores*.

**Q2**: How do unnamed semaphores function in relation to processes?
> **A**: Unnamed semaphores can synchronize threads as well as related processes, which are processes originating from a common parent via the `fork` system call.

**Q3**: How are named semaphores different from unnamed ones?
> **A**: Named semaphores have a distinct name associated with them. They are versatile and can be used for synchronizing threads, related processes, or even unrelated processes running on the same machine.

**Q4**: Which type of semaphore would you use for synchronizing two unrelated processes?
> **A**: For synchronizing two unrelated processes, we would use a *named semaphore*.

**Q5**: What is the primary distinction between mutex and condition variables, unnamed semaphores, and named semaphores in terms of synchronization scope?
> **A**: Mutex and condition variables are limited to synchronizing threads of the same process. Unnamed semaphores extend this synchronization to related processes as well. Named semaphores have the broadest scope, capable of synchronizing any two entities, whether threads, related processes, or unrelated processes.

*Note*: The topic of named semaphores will be explored further in the SQL section of the course, and its detailed discussion is not in the scope of the current course section.
