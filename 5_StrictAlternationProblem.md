# SemaphoreExplained

## Strict Alternation and Semaphores ðŸš¦

### ðŸ“š Introduction

Strict alternation refers to the pattern of execution of threads, ensuring that two threads execute in an alternating manner. This design pattern is of practical significance in scenarios where a pair of threads should execute in a strict alternating manner.

### ðŸŽ¨ Pictorial Representation

Imagine we have two threads, `Thread T1` and `Thread T2`. 
- When `T1` executes and does its work `W1`, `T2` is blocked.
- Once `T1` finishes its `W1` task, it gets blocked, and `T2` resumes its execution performing its `W2` work.
- This cycle of execution-block-execution continues in an alternating manner. 

Challenges include conveying to the next thread when the current thread finishes its execution and vice versa.

### ðŸš¥ Semaphores for Strict Alternation

Semaphores can be used to ensure that these threads execute in strict alternation.

#### ðŸ”µ Zero Semaphores

A key concept used here is **zero semaphores**. These are semaphores initialized with a permit counter value of zero.

**Characteristics**:
1. If a thread invokes the `sem_wait` API immediately after initializing a zero semaphore, the thread is blocked. This happens because the value of the permit counter goes from 0 to -1, and as per semaphore rules, the calling thread gets blocked.
2. If a thread executes `sem_post` on a zero semaphore, its permit counter increases from -1 to 0. Any thread blocked on that semaphore then resumes its execution.

Zero semaphores provide a simplistic method to block and signal threads. They're particularly useful for managing strict alternation in thread execution.

### ðŸ“– Example

**Problem Statement**: Write a program with two threads, `T1` and `T2`. 
- `T1` prints odd numbers between 1 and 15.
- `T2` prints even numbers between 2 and 15.
  
The output should be sequential: 1, 2, 3,... up to 15.

**Solution**:
- Use two zero semaphores.
- Synchronize `T1` and `T2` to execute in strict alternation.

### ðŸ’­ Thought Exercise 

Review the provided solution and ponder on:
- How does this solution work?
- Why are zero semaphores able to solve this problem so gracefully?
- Realize the practical significance of zero semaphores in thread synchronization problems.

## Interview Questions ðŸ¤”

1. **Question**: Can you explain what strict alternation is and why it is significant in thread synchronization?
   
   **Answer**: Strict alternation refers to a pattern where two threads execute in an alternating manner, ensuring only one thread executes at any given time. This pattern is significant in thread synchronization because it prevents concurrent access, potential data races, and ensures orderly execution of threads.

2. **Question**: What are zero semaphores, and how are they different from regular semaphores?

   **Answer**: Zero semaphores are semaphores initialized with a permit counter value of zero. When a thread invokes the `sem_wait` API on a zero semaphore right after initialization, it gets blocked immediately. In contrast, regular semaphores might not block the thread immediately, depending on their initial permit counter value.

3. **Question**: How can zero semaphores be used to solve the problem of printing sequential numbers using two threads?

   **Answer**: Zero semaphores can be used to synchronize two threads in strict alternation. One thread can be blocked using `sem_wait` on a zero semaphore, and the other thread can signal it to resume using `sem_post`. By alternating these calls appropriately between the two threads, we can ensure strict alternation in their execution and achieve sequential printing of numbers.

4. **Question**: Why is strict alternation a special case in thread synchronization that only involves two threads?

   **Answer**: Strict alternation is a design pattern where two threads execute in an alternating manner, one after the other. This design is inherently binary â€“ one thread waits while the other executes and vice versa. Implementing strict alternation with more than two threads would complicate the pattern and defy its very definition.

5. **Question**: In the context of thread synchronization, when might you choose to use zero semaphores over other synchronization primitives?

   **Answer**: Zero semaphores are particularly useful when we need a simple way to block a thread immediately and have it resumed by another thread. They're beneficial in scenarios requiring strict alternation of thread execution, or when one thread needs to signal another to proceed. The immediate blocking nature of zero semaphores makes them suitable for such scenarios, compared to other synchronization primitives.
